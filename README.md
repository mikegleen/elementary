This project deals with problems from the books
_Elementary Basic_ and _Elementary Pascal_ by Ledgard and Singer.

The script `metro.py` implements a solution using the method from the blog
[A Dishonorable Diversion](https://erikyadams.wordpress.com/2018/03/03/a-dishonorable-diversion/).

The script `p_metro.py` is a transliteration of the Pascal code in the book.
